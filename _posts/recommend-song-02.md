这首歌听着听着，随着节奏的递进，会有度过一生的感觉，以及一种对人生的释怀，让人感觉到：生之如舟

中间这段旋律的变化和情绪的递进更是让人觉得尽管生之如舟，但是在旅途上也有精彩

{{< admonition info "生之如舟">}}

And every time I see your face,

the oceans heave up to my heart

You make me wanna strain at the oars,

and soon I can see the shore

Nobody knows who I really am

I never felt this empty before

And if I ever need someone to come along

Who's gonna comfort me, and keep me strong

We are all rowing the boat of fate

The waves keep on coming and we can't escape

But if we ever get lost on our way

The waves would guide you through another day

远くで息をしてる　透明になったみたい

暗闇に思えたけど　目隠しされてただけ

祈りをささげて　新しい日を待つ

鲜やかに　光る海　その果てまで

Nobody knows who I really am

Maybe they just don't give a damn

But if I ever need someone to come along

I know you would follow me, and keep me strong

人の心はうつりゆく　抜け出したくなる

つきはまた新しい周期で　舟を连れてく

And every time I see your face,

the oceans heave up to my heart

You make me wanna strain at the oars,

and soon I can see the shore

Ah，I can't see the shore

When will l see the shore

I want you to know who I really am

I never thought I'd feel this way towards you

And if you ever need someone to come along

I will follow you, and keep you strong

旅はまだ続いてく　穏やかな日も

つきはまた新しい周期で　舟を照らし出す

祈りをささげて　新しい日を待つ

鲜やかに　光る海　その果てまで

And every time I see your face,

the oceans heave up to my heart

You make me wanna strain at the oars,

and soon I can see the shore

运命の船を漕ぎ

波は次から次へと私たちを袭うけど

それも素敌な旅ね　どれも素敌な旅ね
